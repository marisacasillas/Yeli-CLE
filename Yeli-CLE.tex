\section{Introduction}\label{intro}

In their first few years of life, children hear an extraordinary amount
of language. Tracking the distribution and characteristics of this
linguistic input over multiple interactional contexts, across
developmental time, and between different families is a difficult task.
Traditionally, developmental language science has relied on short video
recordings of caregiver-child interaction, at home or in the lab, to get
a grasp on what kinds of language children typically hear. This approach
has been fruitful in teasing out individual and group-based differences
in interactional behaviors (REFS). However, over the last decade or so,
a new method for tracking child language experience has gained rapid
popularity: daylong recordings. Daylong recordings are typically made
from a single audio recorder worn by the target child at home,
unleashing participants from the limits of a single-camera and allowing
them to freely navigate their environment for multiple hours at a time.
Unfortunately, however, daylong recordings often require immense
resources in order to extract meaningful lingusitic information from the
audio signal.

Daylong recordings may therefore appear at first blush to have little
value in settings where researchers can instead invest their time in
ethnographic microanalysis with selective, short recordings that have
high emic validity and considerable semantic depth. In particular,
researchers investigating language development outside of their own
cultural context may struggle in deciding with which approach is best;
identifying \enquote{typical} or \enquote{representative} behaviors to
record and measure requires intensive familiarization with participating
families and the community at large, but hasty collection and analysis
of daylong data risks mischaracterizing language use and language
learning in that community. In the present study we investigate the
differing perspectives offered by intensive, close study of short
recordings collected during ethnographic study and broad, panoramic
recordings of the language landscape using daylong methods. We contrast
the use of these two approaches---hereafter the Close-Study approach and
the Panoramic approach---on a single language community: Rossel Island,
Papua New Guinea.

\subsection{The Close-Study approach}\label{the-close-study-approach}

Short, multimodal recordings (e.g., audio plus video data, motion
tracking, or eye movements), give rich insight into the moment-to-moment
characteristics of interaction. The increased context provided by
multi-modal recordings helps discern the meaning of each communicative
behavior documented, including young children's sometimes-jumbled
linguistic productions (REFS). Such recordings can be made in nearly any
context, take little time to collect, and are consistent with other,
more costly and time-consuming recording styles (REFS). When richly
annotated and paired with intensive ethnographic study, these recordings
become potent samples of language development in the studied community
that can be used again and again for a wide variety of meaningul
analyses.

Ethnographic work is essential for appropriately situating recording
collection, chosen behaviors for analysis, and data interpretation
within the realm of normal and relevant behaviors for the studied
community. In practice, this approach means that decisions on what to
study and precisely how to study it are informed by knowledge of daily
tasks, typical household relations and responsibilities, attitudes about
child rearing, considerations about when children qualify as
co-interactants, and what behaviors are expected of children and
caregivers in the first years of life. In a situation where the
researcher is a member of the community under study (e.g., middle-class
US researchers investigating language development in middle-class US
families), assumptions about what to study and how are implicitly
enriched by this knowledge. However, when the researcher is a visitor to
the community, selecting the right measures and finding ways to compare
them to child development outcomes in other sites is an serious
challenge.

The drawbacks of the Close-Study approach are few but significant.
First, the time and financial investment needed to gain familiarity with
a community and to add detailed, comprehensive annotation and
transcription to the gathered recordings limit the feasible sample size
of most studies; language development in a handful of focal children may
provide many insights, but may take decades of dedicated work to explore
in depth. Second, while researchers using this method can dilligently
track a variety interactional contexts, the anchoring effect of a single
video camera or audio recorder on the child (and caregivers) makes it
difficult to capture daily activities that involve a lot of free motion
(e.g., talking while running with other children in a field) or access
to parts of the household or activities that are typically not
accessible to others, even researchers on close terms with the recorded
family (e.g., pre-sleep routines in bedding areas). There may be
meaningful and frequent sources of linguistic information during these
hard-to-capture activities. Finally, unless a microphone is worn by the
child, whispered speech, speech to self, and other quiet but hearable
events are difficult to capture from a third-person recording
perspective.

\subsection{The Panoramic approach}\label{the-panoramic-approach}

Improved recording hardware and advances in speech technology in the
last 20 years have allowed us to peek into children's broader language
landscapes. These recordings give a bird's eye view into the ebb and
flow of everyday language activity, inclusive of both animated chatter
while running with siblings and quiet self-directed talk when sitting
alone. This broadened view is uniquely suited to estimating the total
linguistic input children encounter, and the typical axes on which this
input rate varies (e.g., specific speakers, times of day, etc.).
Accurate measures of linguistic input are critical for investigating how
much experience is needed to acquire a given linguistic or communicative
phenomenon (REFS). Starting up daylong recordings is quick and
straightforward---the main hurdle is getting the child to wear the
vest/shirt in which the recorder is placed---and researchers have had
success implementing these recordings in a wide range of cultural
contexts (REFS; but see Defina REFS). The most popular daylong recording
system is the LENA, which comes with a recording device that captures up
to 16 hours of audio at a time and comes with software for automatically
analyzing basic properties of the speech signal (REFS). The LENA system
is expensive, but is not the only route to daylong data; several groups
have succesfully experimented with daylong recordings using other
devices (e.g., Olympus, Zoom, USB recorder) paired with manual or
open-source automated annotation (REFS). Once an efficient pipeline for
annotation is established, daylong recordings can also be used to
collect comparable recordings from large, representative samples of a
given language community (REFS).

The Panoramic approach has several significant drawbacks (REFS),
particularly for research questions that involve linguistic analysis.
Here we focus on those drawbacks that prevail even when we assume that
the researcher has some resources to add manual or automated linguistic
annotation. First, the resulting recording collections are typically too
large for comprehensive transcription or annotation, with no easy way to
scan for the specific phenomena of interest. Researchers must therefore
employ some strategic sub-sampling technique in order to annotate the
data, even though best practices for doing so are not yet well
established (REFS). Second, even once clips are sampled from the daylong
recording, adding relevant annotations to them can take nearly as long
as a Close-Study approach, but with reduced likelihood of capturing
interesting or relevant caregiving and language use behaviors. Third, a
whole day of recording is a lot of data, but may not be enough to
achieve a stable estimate of average linguistic input (REFS Anderson \&
Fausey, in prep). A fourth drawback is that properly collecting,
processing, and archiving daylong data is not easily achieved; the fact
that participants are likely to habituate to the recorder is fantastic
for documenting ecologically valid language use, but raises urgent
questions about participant privacy standards (REFS Ethics). Fourth, at
time of writing, there are few options for capturing visual information
across the day (but see REFS), limiting this method primarily to
acoustic phenomena (REFS). Even if researchers add manual annotation to
these audio files, they typically do so without the benefit of the
visual context; a difficulty compounded by the diversity of activities
and interlocutors captured over the recording.

\subsection{Differing perspectives on the child language
environment}\label{differing-perspectives-on-the-child-language-environment}

Which approach should one choose when describing children's language
environments? The Close Study approach takes the general stance that
richer data is better data, with the primary problem being that the
researcher can't know how well their zoomed-in perspective generalizes
to the rest of the population. The Panoramic approach takes the general
stance that more data is better data, with the primary problem being
that the researcher can't know if they are measuring the right
phenomena, particularly when importing pre-conceived notions about
learning into culturally unfamiliar contexts. The ideal solution, of
course, is to thoroughly annotate and analyze large, representative
samples of data, but doing so would require many years of well-funded
multi-researcher commitment---a risky prospect for a basic descriptive
question.

One alternative approach is to add complementary data to a community
where one approach has already been taken. For example, extensive
ethnographic research among multiple indigenous Mayan communities of
Southern Mexico and Guatemala has forged a consistent view of
childrearing and child-directed speech: adult caregivers shape infants'
and young children's worlds such that the children learn to attend to
what is going on around them rather than expecting to be the center of
attention (REFS). These findings lay out a broader ideology of
caregiving, including component attitudes (e.g., orientation toward
infants as \emph{not} conversational partners) that can, in turn, be
used to make predictions about Mayan children's linguistic input.
Importantly, however, it is not clear how these attitudes play out on
the scale of day-long averages; preferences for when and how to talk to
children are balanced by the many other demands of everyday life. On
this view, we may feel certain that the Panoramic view indeed captures
the transmission of critical linguistic and cultural knowledge, but we
can't point to where it happens. That said, a handful of findings up
until now suggest a promising, though imperfect link between the
attitudes and ideologies described in Close Study work and the broader
behavioral patterns from Panoramic work in those same communities.

In the case of Mayan child language environments, findings using a
larger-sample or Panoramic-type approach have been fairly consistent
with the caregiving practices described in previous Close Study work.
Shneidman (REFS) used short videos of interaction to conduct a
quantitative, longitudinal study of the Yucatec children's typical
speech experiences. She indeed found that infants were rarely spoken to,
but that the prevalence of speech directed to children increased
enormously with age, mostly due to an influx of speech from other
children (REFS). That said, the input rate from adults predicted
children's later vocabulary size more than their total input rate
(REFS). Casillas and colleagues (REFS) used daylong recordings with
children in a Tseltal Mayan community, again finding that infants and
young children were spoken to rarely. However, they found no increase in
speech input with age, and the majority of speech came from adult women,
even when children were old enough to independently follow their older
siblings and cousins around. The studies collectively suggest that,
consistent with Close Study work in these and similar communities,
(female) adult speech is relatively rare, but is a prominent and
predictive source of linguistic input in Mayan children's language
development.

Studies in a North American context, in which North American researchers
can more reliably depend on their own intuitions about language
learning, have tried to pinpoint the differences in close-up and
zoomed-out views of the child language environment: short recordings
display much denser input, with some changes in the types of language
used, compared to longer recordings (Bergelson, Amatuni, Dailey,
Koorathota, \& Tor, 2019; Tamis-LeMonda, Kuchirko, Luo, Escobar, \&
Bornstein, 2017). For example, Bergelson and colleagues (Bergelson et
al., 2019) analyzed the noun use encountered by 44 6- and 7-month-old
children in the US in both hour-long at-home videos and comparable
sub-samples of daylong recordings. The video and daylong data were
markedly different in linguistic input rate; nouns were used 2--4 times
more often in the videos. The authors also found some differences in
input type: nouns were more likely to come embedded in questions in the
videos, but the daylong data featured more noun types and noun input
from more speakers (see (Bergelson et al., 2019) for the full range of
differences). Other than these differences, the overall profile of input
\emph{type} was quite similar between the video data and the daylong
recording sub-samples (e.g., similar relative use of speech act types).
Other work using varying durations of video (i.e., short-structured
vs.~longer-unstructured video) with US child-caregiver pairs also found
lower estimates for the rate of linguistic input in longer recordings,
but found that children's relative rank was stable across recording
contexts (Tamis-LeMonda et al., 2017).

Based on these findings from both the Mayan and US context, one might
infer that the language use captured by Panoramic recordings is driven,
at least in part, by the same factors driving language patterns
highlighted in Close Study work. However, these preliminary results also
hint at divergences between what caregivers do under ideal or
performative circumstances and what they do when juggling childcare with
the diverse activities and interlocutors encountered during everyday
life. In trying to understand how children's language environments
impact their language learning, researchers seek meaningful variation in
children's linguistic experience; it may be that, with panoramic data,
much of the variation children encounter has less to do with their
caregivers' ideological stance toward talking to young children and more
to do with who else is around and what other tasks are at hand.

Whether this circumstantial variation has greater or equal predictive
validity to variation in caregiver ideology across a range of linguistic
skills is an open question in need of further research. For example, it
is difficult at present to determine the extent to which Mayan children
hear less directed input because of the childrearing practices
traditional to these communities or because of other features of their
lifestyle (e.g., subsistence farming effects on who is present, number
of other children present, etc.; see also Shneidman REFS). Our
comparison group, US families, differ greatly from these Mayan
communities in the circumstances of everyday life (e.g., work patterns,
number of co-residents, child sleeping routines; REFS). Disentangling
the sources of differences in the quantity of linguistic input children
experience issue requires us to collect Close Study and Panoramic
findings in a third community; one with a (broadly) similar lifestyle to
that of the Mayans, but with different ideas about how to talk to young
children.

\subsection{The current study}\label{the-current-study}

In this study we present analyses of daylong recordings from a
small-scale indigenous group, on Rossel Island, Papua New Guinea (PNG),
in which prior ethnographic work has painted a clear picture of early
caregiver-child interaction: child-centric, face-to-face interaction
from the first days of infancy. Based on the prior ethnographic work,
detailed below, we made four predictions about children's speech
environments. First, we predicted that children on Rossel Island would
hear frequent child-directed speech from a wide variety of caregiver
types throughout the day. Second, given that infants are frequently
passed between caregivers, we expected to see weaker effects of the
subsistence farming schedule on Rossel children's input than has been
found in other societies (Casillas et al., forthcoming). Third, as
children get older, we expected to see a large increase in the
proportion of child-directed speech coming from other children (see also
Shneidman REFS). Fourth, we expected a large quantity of other-directed
speech around them, given the large number of family numbers typically
present. Based on prior work with daylong recordings with both Western
and non-Western small-scale populations, we additionally expected (a) no
age-related increase in child-directed speech (Scaff, Casillas,
Bergelson, REFS), (b) an age-related decrease in other-directed speech
(Casillas, Bergelson, REFS), and (c) that children's input would be
non-uniformly distributed over the day (Abney, Smith, \& Yu, 2017;
Blasi, Schikowski, Moran, Pfeiler, \& Stoll, in preparation) such that
interactional peaks present a much denser view of their input (Casillas
et al., forthcoming), similar to that observed in more Close-Study
approaches.

In what follows we will review the ethnographic work done with this
community previously, describe our methods for following up on these
findings with daylong recordings, present the current findings, and
discuss the differences that arose. This study was completed as part of
a larger comparative project focusing on children's speech environments
and linguistic development at two sites: the Tseltal Mayan community
mentioned above (Casillas et al., forthcoming) and this Rossel Island
community. Therefore all methods for annotation and analysis in this
study parallel those reported elsewhere for Tseltal Mayan children's
speech environments (Casillas, Brown, \& Levinson, forthcoming).

\section{Method}\label{methods}

\subsection{Corpus}\label{methods-dataset}

The participants in this study live in a collection of small hamlets on
north-eastern Rossel Island, approximately 250 nautical miles off the
southern tip of mainland Papua New Guinea. The traditional language of
Rossel Island is Yélî Dnye, a presumed Papuan isolate, which features a
phonological inventory and set of grammatical features that are unlike
any other in the (predominantly Austronesian) languages of the region.
Rosselers are skilled farmers, cultivating taro, sweet potato, manioc,
yam, coconut, and more for their daily subsistence, with protein coming
from fishing and (occasionally) slaughtering pigs or local animals. Most
children on Rossel Island grow up speaking Yélî Dnye monolingually at
home, beginning to learn English as a second language once they begin
school around age 7 or 8. Children grow up in patrilocal household
clusters (i.e., their family and their father's brothers families),
usually arranged such that there is some shared open space between
households.

During their waking hours, infants are typically carried in a
caregiver's arms as they go about daily activities. Infants, even very
young ones, are frequently passed between different family members (male
and female, young and elderly) throughout the day, returning to the
mother to suckle when hungry. The arc of a typical day for an infant
might include waking, being dressed and fed, then a mix of (a) spending
time with nearby adults or older children as they walk around
socializing and completing tasks with others and (b) more feeding,
perhaps followed by short bouts of sleep in the late morning and
afternoon, usually with the mother. Afternoon meals are cooked from
around 15:00 onward, with another meal time and more socializing at home
before resting for the night. Starting around age two or three, children
also begin to spend a lot of their time in large, independent child
playgroups involving up to 10 or more cousins at a time who freely
travel near and around the village searching for nuts and fruits,
bathing in nearby rivers, and engaging in group games (e.g., tag,
pretend play, etc.).

Interaction with infants and young children on Rossel Island is
initiated by women, men, girls, and boys alike in a face-to-face,
contingency-seeking, and affect-laden style (Brown REFS). Children are
considered a shared responsibility, but also a source of joy and
entertainment for the wider network of caregivers in their community. In
her prior ethnographic work, Brown details some ways in which
interactants make bids for joint attention and act as if the infant can
understand what is being said (REFS). Infants pick up on this pattern of
caregiving, intiating interactions with others twice as frequently as
Tseltal children, who are encouraged instead to be observers of the
interactions going on around them (Brown 2011 REFS). At the same time,
Brown (REFS) documents how Rossel caregivers encourage early
independence in their children, observing their autonomy in choosing
what to do, wear, eat, and say while finding other ways to promote
pro-social behavior (e.g., praise; REFS). Overall, Rossel Island could
be characterized as a child-centered language environment (Ochs \&
Schieffelin 1984; REFS but see Brown \& Casillas REFS), in which
children, even very young ones, are considered interactional and
conversational partners whose interests are allowed to shape the topic
and direction of conversation.

We were interested in using Panoramic methods to investigate the
language environment of children acquiring Yélî Dnye because prior
ethnographic work had suggested that child-directed speech is highly
frequent in this community, from mothers and other adult caregivers, but
also from other children. The typologically rare and complex structures
characteristic of Yélî Dnye phonology and morphosyntax makes Rossel
Island a theoretically intriguing place for extended language
development study. For present purposes, and intial study of how much
linguistic input children encounter, and how it varies within the home
context, allows a first glimpse into the material available for children
to learn from. At the same time, this work further our understanding of
the different perspectives offered by the Close-Study and Panoramic
approaches cross-culturally.

The data presented here come from Rossel Island subset of the Casillas
HomeBank Corpus (Casillas, Brown, \& Levinson, 2017), a collection of
raw daylong recordings and supplementary data from over 100 children
under age four growing up on Rossel Island and in the Tseltal Mayan
community described elsewhere (Casillas et al. forthcoming). The Rossel
Island subcorpus was collected in 2016 and includes daylong audio
recordings and experimental data from 57 children born to XX mothers. On
average, the target children in these recordings had X--X younger
siblings (mean = X; median = X) and X--X older siblings (mean = X;
median = X); most participating parents were on the younger end of
parents in the community (mothers: mean = XX years; median = XX; range =
XX--XX and fathers: mean = XX; median = XX; range = XX---XX). Based on
our demographic data we estimate that mothers are typically XX years old
when they give birth to their first child (median = XX; range = XX--XX)
with an average inter-child interval of X years (median = X; range =
X--X). Notably, however, we received several reports, including from
nursing staff at the local health clinic, that mothers now are having
children younger and closer together than in generations past. Household
size, defined here as the number of people sharing kitchen and sleeping
areas on a daily basis, ranged between X and XX (mean = X; meadian = X).
Households are clustered into small hamlets which form a wider group of
communal caregivers and playmates. The hamlets themselves are clustered
together into broader patches of patrilocal residents. The average
hamlet in our corpus comprises X households (median = X; range = X--X);
assuming an average of X children under age seven (i.e., not schooling)
and X adults per household, we estimate that there are between XX and XX
children and between XX and XX adults present throughout the day, not
including visitors, visits to neighboring hamlets or other nearby
resident areas. Therefore, while XX\% of the target children in our
corpus are first born to their mothers, they are immediately
incorporated into a much larger pool of young children whose care is
divided among numerous caregivers. Among our participating families,
most mothers had finished primary school (XX\%; X years of education) or
secondary school (XX\%; X years of education), with a few having
completed preparatory school (XX\%; X years of education) or beyond
(XX\%; X years of education). Only XX\% of mothers had less than a
primary school education. Similarly, most fathers had finished primary
school (XX\%; X years of education) or secondary school (XX\%; X years
of education), with a few having completed preparatory school (XX\%; X
years of education) or beyond (XX\%; X years of education), with only
XX\% having less than a primary school education. To our knowledge at
the time of recording, all but two children were typically developing;
one showed signs of significant language delay and one showed signs of
multiple developmental delay (motor, language, intellectual), both
children's delays were consistently observed in follow-up trips in 2018
and 2019.

Dates of birth for children were initially collected via parent report.
We were able to verify the vast majority of birth dates using the
records at the island health clinic. Because not all mothers give birth
at the clinic and because dates are written by hand, some births are not
recorded, are inaccurately recorded, or otherwise significantly diverge
from what the parents report. In these cases we gathered information
from as many sources as possible and followed up with the families,
often using the dates of neighboring children born around the same time
to home in on the correct date.

The data we present come from 7--9-hour recordings of a waking day at
home for the child. Children wore the recording device, which was an
elastic vest containing a small stereo audio recorder (Olympus WS-832 or
WS-853) and a miniature camera that captured photos of the child's
frontal view at a fixed interval (every 15 seconds; Narrative Clip 1).
The camera was outfitted with a fisheye lens that, while distorting the
images, allowed us to capture 180 degrees of children's frontal view.
This technique allows us to use daylong recordings while also partially
getting around the traditional Panoramic-method sacrifice of no visual
context, thereby increasing ease and reliability of our transcrition and
annotation. However, because the camera and recorder are separate
devices, we had to synchronize them manually after the recordings were
made. To do this, we used an external wristwatch to record the current
time at start of recording on each device individually, with accuracy
down to the second (photographed by the camera and spoken into the
recorder). The camera timestamps each photo such that we can calculate
the number of seconds that have elapsed between each one. These
timestamps can be used with the cross-device time synchronization cue to
create photo-linked audio files of each recording, which we then format
as video files (see \url{https://github.com/marisacasillas/Weave} for
post-processing scripts and more information). The informed consent
process used with participants, as well as data collection and storage,
were conducted in accordance with ethical guidelines approved by the
Radboud University Social Sciences Ethics Committee.

\subsection{Data selection and annotation}\label{methods-samples}

From the daylong recordings of XX Rossel children, we selected 10
representative children between ages 0;0 and 3;0 for transcription and
analysis in the current study. The 10 children were selected to be
spread between the target age range (0;0--3;0) while also representing a
range of typical maternal education levels found in the community and
being evenly split between male and female children (see also ACLEW
REFS). For each child we then selected a series of non-overalapping
sub-clips from the day for transription in the following order: nine
randomly-selected 2.5-minute clips, five manually-selected
\enquote{peak} turn-taking activity 1-minute clips, five
manually-selected \enquote{peak} vocal activity 1-minute clips, and one
manually-selected 5-minute expansion of the best one-minute clip, for a
total of 37.5 minutes of transcribed audio for each child (6.25 audio
hours in total). The criteria for manual clip selection are identical to
those described for the parallel study on Tseltal by Casillas and
colleagues (forthcoming).

We were limited to selecting sub-clips from 10 children for analysis
because of the time-intensive nature of transcribing these naturalistic
data; 1 minute of audio typically took approximately 60--70 minutes to
be segmented into utterances, transcribed, annotated, and loosely
translated into English (\textasciitilde{}400 hours total). Given that
Yélî Dnye is nearly exclusively spoken on Rossel Island, where there is
no electricity and unreliable access to mobile data, transcription could
only be completed over the course of three 4--6 week visits by our
research group to the island in 2016, 2018, and 2019.

We used the ACLEW Annotation Scheme (REFS) in ELAN (ELAN REFS) to
transcribe and annotate all hearable speech---both near and distant---in
the clips. We first segmented out the utterances and ascribed them to
individual speakers (e.g., older brother, mother, aunt, etc.). We then
annotated the vocal maturity of each utterance produced by the target
child (non-canonical babble/canonical babble/single
word/multi-word/unsure) and annotated the addressee of all speech from
other speakers (addressed to the target child/one or more other
children/one or more adults/a mix of adults and children/any
animal/other/unsure). Transcription and annotation was done together by
the first author and one of three community members (all native speakers
of Yélî Dnye). The community-based research assistants personally knew
all the families in the recordings, and were able to use their own
experience, the discourse context, and information from the accompanying
photos in reporting what was said and to whom speech was addressed for
each utterance. Detailed manuals and self-guided training materials,
including a \enquote{gold standard test} for this annotation scheme can
be found at URL (REFS).

In what follows we first analyze the nine randomly selected 2.5-minute
clips from each child to establish a baseline view of their speech
environment, focusing on the effects of child age, time of day,
household size, and number of speakers on the rate of target
child-directed (TCDS) and other-directed speech (ODS) present. Next, we
repeat these analyses, focusing instead only on the turn-taking clips to
gain a view of the speech environment as it appears during the peak
interactions for the day. This latter set of analyses may more closely
mirror results from prior ethnographic work, which was designed to focus
on typical, lively interactions with young children. Then as a first
approximation of children's linguistic development, we map a coarse
trajectory of children's use of babble, first words, and multi-word
utterances. Finally, we wrap up by integrating our Panoramic-approach
results with those from prior Close-Study work, relating these findings
to the larger literature on child-directed speech and its role in
language development.

\subsection{Statistical models}\label{statistical-models}

We conducted all analyses in R, using the glmmTMB package to run
generalized linear mixed-effects regressions on our dependent measures
(M. E. Brooks et al., 2017; R Core Team, 2018). We used ggplot2 to
generate all plots (Wickham, 2009). The dataset and scripts used in this
study can be found at \url{https://github.com/marisacasillas/Yeli-CLE}.
As in previous work on child speech environment measures (REFS Casillas
et al. forthcoming, Bunce et al, in prep), TCDS and ODS minutes per hour
are naturally restricted to non-negative (0--infinity) values, causing
the distributional variance of those measures to become positively
skewed. To address this issue we use negative binomial regressions,
which can better fit non-negative, overdispersed data (M. E. Brooks et
al., 2017; Smithson \& Merkle, 2013). There were also many cases of zero
minutes of TCDS across the clips---for example, this often occurred in
the randomly sampled clips when the child was sleeping in a quiet area.
To handle this additional distributional characteristic of the data, we
added a zero-inflation model to TCDS analysis which, in addition to the
count model of TCDS (e.g., testing effects of age on the input rate),
creates a a binary model to evaluate the likelihood of TCDS being used
at all. More conventional, gaussian linear mixed-effects regressions
with logged dependent variables are available in the Supplementary
Materials. The results of those alternative models are qualitatively
similar to what we report here.

\section{Results}\label{results}

The models included the following predictors: child age (months;
centered and standardized), household size (number of people; centered
and standardized), number of non-target-child speakers present in that
clip (centered and standardized), and time of day at the start of the
clip (factor: \enquote{morning} = before 11:00; \enquote{midday} =
11:00--13:00; \enquote{afternoon} = after 13:00). In addition, we
included two-way interactions: (a) child age and the number of speakers
present and (b) child age and time of day. We also added a random effect
of child. For the zero-inflation model of TCDS, we included the number
of speakers present. We limit our discussion here to significant effects
in the models; full model results, including gaussian alternative
models, are available in the Supplementary Materials.

\subsection{Target-child-directed speech
(TCDS)}\label{target-child-directed-speech-tcds}

In the random sample, these 10 children heard an average of 3.13 minutes
of speech directly addressed to them per hour (median = 2.95; range =
1.58--6.26; \protect\hyperlink{fig3}{Figure 3}). For comparison, this is
slightly less than reported values using a near-identical method of data
collection, annotation, and analysis in a Tseltal Mayan community (3.6
minutes per hour for children under 3;0; Casillas et al., fortchoming)
and comparable to what has been reported using a similar method in a
Tsimane community (4.8 minutes per hour for children under 3;0 including
all hearable speech; 1.6 minutes when excluding overlap and far-away
speech; Scaff et al., in prep).

The zero-inflated negative binomial regression of TCDS minutes per hour
(N = 90, log-likelihood = -195.26, overdispersion estimate = 3.37)
suggested significant effects of child age, time of day, and their
interaction on the rate at which children hear speech addressed directly
to them. First, the older children heard significantly more TCDS per
hour (B = 0.73, SD = 0.23, z = 3.20, p \textless{} 0.01), with an
average increase of 0.73 minutes per hour for every month of
development. Overall, these children were also more likely to hear TCDS
in the mornings (see \protect\hyperlink{fig4}{Figure 4} for an overview
of time-of-day findings), with significantly higher TCDS rates in the
morning compared to both midday (B = 0.80, SD = 0.36, z = 2.23, p =
0.03) and the afternoon (B = 0.54, SD = 0.26, z = 2.10, p = 0.04), and
no significant difference in TCDS rate between midday and the afternoon.
However, the time-of-day pattern changed with child age. Older children
were more likely than younger children to show a peak in TCDS during
midday, with a decrease in TCDS between midday and the afternoon (B =
-0.60, SD = 0.29, z = -2.04, p = 0.04) and marginally less TCDS in the
morning than at midday (B = -0.59, SD = 0.30, z = -1.94, p = 0.05).
There were no other significant effects in either the count or the
zero-inflation model.

Children heard TCDS from a variety of different speakers. Overall, most
TCDS came from adults (mean = 72.65\%, median = 75.51\%, range =
41.41--100\%). On average, 77.23\% of the adult TCDS per clip came from
women, and an average of 82.35\% of the total adult TCDS minutes came
from women. That said, an increasing quantity of TCDS came from other
children (child-TCDS; \enquote{C-TCDS}); a Spearman's correlation showed
a significant positive relationship between the average proportion of
child TCDS in a clip and target child age (Spearman's \emph{rho} = 0.78;
\emph{p} = 0.01).

the data for children age 1;0 and younger (light) or age 1;0 and older
(dark) at the given time of day.}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Other-directed speech
(ODS)}\label{other-directed-speech-ods}

In the random sample, these children heard an average of 35.90 minutes
of other-directed speech per hour (median = 32.37; range =
20.20--53.78): that is more than eleven times the average quantity of
speech directed to them, with some children experiencing near-continuous
background speech. For comparison, a prior estimate for Tseltal Mayan
children using parallel methods to the present study found an average of
21 minutes of overhearable speech per hour (Casillas et al.,
forthcoming), and a recent study of North American children's daylong
recordings found that adult-directed speech occurred at a rate of 7.3
minutes per hour (Bergelson et al., 2019).

The negative binomial regression of other-directed speech rate (N = 90,
log-likelihood = -370.87, overdispersion estimate = 9.14) revealed
effects of child age, number of speakers present, and time of day on the
rate of ODS encountered. The rate of ODS significantly decreased with
child age (B = -0.57, SD = 0.17, z = -3.28, p \textless{} 0.01) and
significantly increased in the presence of more speakers (B = 0.50, SD =
0.05, z = 10.07, p \textless{} 0.001). Across clips, there were an
average of 6.19 speakers present other than the target child in the
randomly selected clips (median = 6; range = 1--19), an average of
59.99\% of whom were adults. Comparing again to Tseltal and North
American English, in which the average number of speakers present was
3.44 and XX respectively (REFS)({\textbf{???}}), we can infer that the
increased rate of ODS on Rossel Island is due in part to there simply
being more speakers present. Time-of-day effects on ODS only came
through in an interaction with child age. In particular, older children
heard a pattern of ODS mirroring the general pattern of TCDS;
significantly more ODS in the mornings compared to midday
(midday-vs-morning: B = 0.65, SD = 0.20, z = 3.23, p \textless{} 0.01)
and the afternoon (afternoon-vs-morning: B = 0.37, SD = 0.15, z = 2.50,
p = 0.01). There were no other significant effects on ODS rate in the
model.

In sum, the random baseline rates of TCDS and ODS in children's speech
environments are influenced by child age (TCDS increases, ODS
decreases), time of day (both generally peak in the morning), and their
interaction (older children hear more TCDS and less ODS at midday). The
rate of ODS is also impacted by the large number of speakers present in
some clips. Correlational results suggest that children's TCDS comes
increasingly from other children over the first three years. That said,
the baseline rate of TCDS is low, on par with estimates in other
small-scale farming communities (Casillas et al., forthcoming; Scaff et
al., in prep); while the ODS rate is quite high relative to estimates in
prior work.

\subsection{TCDS and ODS during interactional
peaks}\label{tcds-and-ods-during-interactional-peaks}

If we instead investigate the rates of TCDS and ODS encountered by these
children during their interactional peaks for the day, a different
picture emerges (\protect\hyperlink{fig3}{Figures 3} and
\protect\hyperlink{fig4}{4} green/dashed summaries). In particular, the
children heard much more TCDS in the turn-taking clips---14.45 min/hr;
that is, more than four times the rate of TCDS in the random baseline
(median = 15.07; range = 9.61--18.73). During these same clips, children
heard a reduced rate of ODS: 25.27 min/hr (70.39\% of the random-sample
ODS rate; median = 19.59; range = 6.68--60.18). The negative binomial
mixed-effects regression of TCDS (N = 55, log-likelihood = -183.25,
overdispersion estimate = 2.91) revealed a significant decrease with
child age (B = -0.63, SD = 0.27, z = -2.33, p = 0.02) and a significant
interaction between child age and time of day; TCDS rate for older
children during interactional peaks was marginally higher at morning
compared to midday (midday-vs-morning: B = 0.53, SD = 0.28, z = 1.89, p
= 0.06) and significantly higher in the afternoon than at midday
(midday-vs-afternoon: B = 0.61, SD = 0.28, z = 2.17, p = 0.03).

As in the random sample, an increasing portion of TCDS during
interactional peaks came from other children. While, overall,
\emph{more} of the TCDS in interactional peaks came from adults than in
the random clips (mean = 82.68\%, median = 88.04\%, range = 50--100\%),
a Spearman's correlation showed an even stronger positive relationship
between the average proportion of child TCDS in a clip and target child
age (Spearman's \emph{rho} = 0.92; \emph{p} = \textless{} 0.001).
Notably, women contributed proportionally less TCDS during interactional
peaks than they did during the random clips: on average, women
contributed 61.55\% of the children's adult TCDS minutes in the
turn-taking clips (compared to 82.35\% in the random clips). In brief,
interactional peaks include more directed speech from men and more
directed speech from other children, with age.

The negative binomial mixed-effects regression of ODS (N = 55,
log-likelihood = -202.60, overdispersion estimate = 4.66) only revealed
a significant effect of number of speakers. As before, ODS rates were
higher when more speakers were present (B = 0.56, SD = 0.08, z = 6.76, p
\textless{} 0.001). There were no other significant effects on ODS rate
in the turn-taking clips.

Overall, the results suggest that these children typically hear very
little directly addressed speech, but that interactional peaks provide
opportunities for dense input at multiple points during the day. While
the majority of directed speech comes from women, an increasing portion
of it comes from other children with age, and directed speech from men
is more likely during interactional peaks. Directed and overhearable
speech is most likely during the morning, before most of the household
has dispersed for their work activities, similar to other work on
subsistence farming households (Casillas et al., forthcoming). However,
older children are more likely than younger children to show higher
input rates at midday, perhaps due to their increased interactions with
other children while adults attend to gardening and domestic tasks; we
leave investigation of this idea to future work. Possibly because of the
large number of speakers typically present, these children also
experienced a high rate of overhearable speech, underscoring the
availability of other-addressed speech as a resource for linguistic
input in this context.

Given the low overall rate of directed speech in these children's
environments, we might expect that their early linguistic development,
particularly the onset and use of single- and multi-word utterances, is
delayed in comparison to children growing up in more CDS-rich
environments. To briefly investigate this we plotted the proportion of
all linguistic vocalizations (i.e., discarding laughter, crying, or
unknown-type vocalizations; leaving N = 4308 vocalizations) for each
child that were (a) non-canonical babble, (b) canonical babble, (c)
single-word utterances, or (d) multi-word utterances. With development,
children are expected to traverse all four types of vocalization,
primarily producing single- and multi-word utterances by age three.

In the onset of use for canonical babble, first words, and multi-word
utterances, these Rossel children's vocalization data closely resemble
expectations based on populations of children who hear more CDS
(\protect\hyperlink{fig5}{Figure 5}). That is, canonical babble appears
in the second half of the first year, first words appear around the
first birthday, and multi-word utterances appear a few months after that
(Frank, Braginsky, Marchman, \& Yurovsky, in preparation; Kuhl, 2004;
Pine \& Lieven, 1993; Slobin, 1970; Tomasello \& Brooks, 1999;
Warlaumont, Richards, Gilkerson, \& Oller, 2014). Notably, these
children also far exceed the usage rate of speech-like vocalizations
associated with major developmental delay; while the canonical babbling
ratio (CBR; proportion speech/speech-like vocalizations out of all
vocalizations) associated with developmental delay is below 0.15 at age
0;10, all the Rossel children above 0;9 exceed this threshold, with a
minimum CBR of 0.22 at age 0;9 (mean = 0.63; median = 0.68; range =
0.22-- 0.86; see also REFS Cychosz et al.).

Over all annotated clips, children produced an average of 7.18
linguistic vocalizations per minute (median = 7.79; range = 4.57--8.95),
which is less than might be expected in American infant-caregiver
recordings (D. K. Oller, Eilers, Basinger, Steffens, \& Urbano, 1995).
However, this rate does align well with the frequency of child-initiated
prompts estimated for Rossel interaction (Brown, 2011). The rate also
matches estimates for Tseltal Mayan children, who hear a similar
quantity of directed speech during this age range (REFS Casillas et
al.).

\section{Discussion}\label{disc}

We analyzed the speech environments of 10 Rossel children under age 3;0
to investigate: (a) how often children were spoken to directly, (b) how
much other overhearable speech is available to them, (c) how these
sources of linguistic input are shaped by child age and interactional
context, and (d) whether this (relatively) low rate of directed input
appears to impact their early production milestones.

Based on prior ethnographic work, we expected that these children would
hear frequent child-directed speech from a wide variety of caregivers
(REFS) and frequent speech directed to others (REFS). In fact children
were rarely directly addressed. This low baseline rate of TCDS is
comparable---even slightly less---than that found in a Tseltal Mayan
community where minimal TCDS is one means to socializing children into
attending to their surroundings (REFS). On the other hand, the Rossel
child speech environment contains ample overhearable speech; much more
than has been reported in other communities at time of writing. We
suspect that both the low relative rate of TCDS and the high incidence
of ODS are partly attributable to the fact that multiple speakers are
typically present in the recordings, as discussed further below.

Prior work using similar methods to those presented here, also led us to
expect that the quantity of TCDS would be stable across the age range
studied (Scaff, Casillas, Bergelson, REFS), and that an increasing
proportion of it would come from other children (Shneidman, Brown,
REFS). Counter to expectations, we found a small but significant
increase in TCDS rate with child age in the random clips and a small but
significant decrease in TCDS rate with age in the turn-taking clips. The
age-related baseline increase in TCDS may derive from more frequent
participation in independent play with other children; in prior work,
increased proportional input from other children was also associated
with an increase in overall input rate (Shneidman refs). The age-related
decrease in TCDS rate during peak interactional moments was not
expected, but may be attributable to this change in interactional
partners with age; if adults are more likely to be the source of TCDS
during interactional peaks for younger children, they may also provide
more voluminous speech during those peaks than other children do during
interactional peaks later in development. Both of these explanations
require follow-up work from a larger sample of children and, ideally,
from a larger sample of their interactions throughout the day. As
expected based on prior Panoramic work (Casillas, Bergelson, REFS), we
did see a decrease in ODS with age, consistent with prior work on both
Western and non-Western samples (REFS).

Finally, while we anticipated that the children's input would be
non-uniformly distributed over the recording day {[}Blasi et al. (in
preparation); Abney et al. (2017); REFS Casillas{]}, we also expected to
see a somewhat even distribution of directed speech from morning to
evening given that young children have been reported to pass between
multiple caregivers during a typical day at home. We expected that this
care-sharing practice might weaken the effect of farming activities on
linguistic input rate, found in the late morning and early afternoon in
previous work with Tseltal Mayan subsistence farmers (Casillas et al.
REFS). In fact, we found that children's rate of linguistic input was
still significantly impacted by time of day, similar to prior work
(Casillas et al. REFS). In paricular, most TCDS and ODS came during the
morning, with older children more likely to hear TCDS at midday than
younger children, possibly because this is when most adults are likely
attending to gardening and domestic duties while children congregate in
large play groups (REFS).

\subsection{Diverging Close-Study and Panoramic
perspectives}\label{diverging-close-study-and-panoramic-perspectives}

Our Panoramic findings differ from expectations based on prior Close
Study work in three primary ways: the minimal use of TCDS with young
children, the effect of time of day on the rate of linguistic input, and
limited variability in the type of speakers talking to children. Based
on evidence that adults and children alike naturally \enquote{talk} to
children, even young infants, as if they can understand and respond
adequately to what is being said (REFS), and a general sense that
infants and young children have access to a wide network of caregivers
who derive much joy from interacting with them, we expected to find that
infants on Rossel Island hear more frequent directed speech than is
found in other subsistence farming contexts, like the Tseltal Mayan
example discussed above (REFS), where speech to children is minimzed in
traditional caregiving practices.

In fact, we found that the 10 Rossel children here heard slightly less
TCDS than was documented using a near-identical method in the case of
the Tseltal children. Taking the Mayan and Papuan findings together, we
suggest that the Panoramic approach does not effectively distinguish
ethnographically distinct caregiver approaches to talking to young
children. While Rossel caregivers view their young children, even their
young infants, as potential co-interactants in conversational play
(REFS), the circumstances of everyday life shape the children's broader
linguistic landscape such that most of what children hear is talk
between others. Specifically we suggest that, in the daylong context,
caregivers from these two subsistence farming communities are
preoccupied for most of the day with social and domestic commitments in
which they are motivated to converse with the other adults and (older)
children present; not just to get these tasks done but also because
these more mature speakers enable more complex verbal interactions.
Given the multi-generational and patrilocal settlement patterns in each
communities, there are ample daily opportunities to seek the company of
other adults and older children. This same explanation extends to the
variability in linguistic input encountered by children over the day and
from different speaker types; rather than being passed between
caregivers who are \enquote{free} to interact, young children may
accompany their varied caregivers in their daily tasks, switching from
lap to lap without the activity context changing.

When it comes to quantifying how much linguistic input children
encounter, the Panoramic view yields the important insight that direct
linguistic input is rare on average; it exists, but only during short
interactional peaks. We suspect that it is during these interactional
peaks, similar to what is typically captured in Close-Study approaches,
that caregiver attitudes about how to engage children in interaction are
most clearly expressed. Indeed it is during these interactional peaks
when we see not only more TCDS but also TCDS from more diverse speaker
types. In the broader Panoramic data, the number of speakers present and
the routines of everyday life have a much stronger impact on children's
linguistic environment. In sum, the forces shaping the \emph{frequency}
of Rossel children's linguistic input are somewhat independent from the
forces shaping the \emph{format} of their linguistic input. This insight
is critical in trying to join cognitive and social models of children's
early language development. After all, children---particularly children
in contexts with minimal TCDS---may do most of their language learning
during these short bursts in the day when they are jointly attending to
language during interactions with others. If so, it would be more
effecient to aim our models of learning and annotation time at these
interactional peaks. Indeed, such a hybrid approach may be optimal for
accessing varied, ecologically valid, culturally distinct codes of
verbal interaction while also sketching a stable picture of early
language exposure specific those same communities (REFS). Initial
evidence for this idea already comes from one of Bergelson and
colleagues' (REFS) results, in which the most frequent nouns used were
more similar across households in the daylong samples than the video
samples. Further work on children's ability to learn from to direct and
overhearable language in both the Rossel and the Tseltal context are
important future routes for investigation of the importance of
interactional peaks for learning (REFS; Shneidman; see also BURSTY
REFS).

\subsection{Independence and
child-TCDS}\label{independence-and-child-tcds}

The increase in TCDS from other children in this Rossel data recalls
findings from Shneidman and Goldin-Meadow (REFS) in which Yucatec Mayan
children's directed speech rate increased enormously with age, primarily
due to increased input from other children. We saw a significant, but
much smaller increase in TCDS in these 10 Rossel children's recordings,
with an increasing proportion of that input coming from children.
Interestingly, a prior study using near-identical methods to this one
with a Tseltal Mayan community---culturally more similar to the Yucatec
community studied in Shneidman and Goldin-Meadow (REFS)---found no
evidence for increased input from other children (REFS). The lack of
child TCDS in that study was attributed to the observation that Tseltal
Mayan children only begin to engage in independent, extended play with
older siblings and cousins after age three, older than the sampled
children in the study. In comparison, prior ethnographic work on Rossel
Island highlights independence as a primary concern for parents of young
children; from early toddlerhood Rossel children are encouraged to
choose how they dress, when and what to eat, and who to visit (REFS).
The formation of hamlets in a cluster around a shared open space,
typically close to a water source with a shallow area, further nurtures
a sense of safe, free space in which children can wander. These features
of childhood on Rossel Island support extended independent play with
siblings and cousins from an early age and may therefore explain the
strongly increasing presence of child TCDS in the present data. Further
work, combining the time of day effects and interlocutor effects found
here with ethnographic interview data, are needed to explore these idea
in full. The consequence of this pattern for learning is that children's
linguistic input shifts in the first three years, with proportionally
more speech coming from less mature talkers; how this influences their
early production and comprehension patterns is a matter for future
research.

\subsection{Limitations}\label{limitations}

The present study used Panoramic methods to get a broader view of 10
Rossel children's linguistic landscapes, but was limited in both the
number of children represented and the number of annotated minutes
analyzed per child. The data presented here, though transcribed, were
only analyzed for superficial features of children's linguistic
environment: input rates of directed and overhearable speech and
children's overall vocal maturity. Semantically rich interpretations of
what children are saying and hearing require more of a Close Study
approach, including cross-cultural differences in the \emph{format} of
child-directed speech (sometimes called CDS \enquote{quality}). We note
that the most promising long-term approaches for a comparative
developmental approach include a focus on how within-community
differences or cross-linguistic differences for related languages drive
variation in learning (e.g., Pye, 2017; Weisleder \& Fernald, 2013). The
data presented here come from an evolving corpus of Yélî Dnye
developmental data; any reader interested in citing descriptive features
of the Rossel child language environment should visit the following
address for up-to-date estimates:

The analyses on that site will include any new data, annotations, and
analyses added after the publication of this study.

\subsection{Conclusion}\label{disc-conclusion}

Using the Panoramic approach, we estimate that, on average, children on
Rossel Island under age 3;0 hear 3.13 minutes of directed speech per
hour, with an average of 14.45 minutes per hour during peak interactive
moments during the day. Most of the directed speech they hear comes from
adults, but older children hear more directed speech from other
children. There is also an average 35.90 minutes per hour of
overhearable speech children might be able to learn from. Older children
heard more directed speech and less overhearable speech than younger
children; though a far greater gain in ratio of directed-to-overhearable
speech is observable for all children in our sample within the peak
interactions for the day. Despite this relatively low rate of directed
speech, these children's vocal maturity appears on-track with norms for
typically developing children in English (REFS) and other typologically
diverse languages (REFS). Our findings diverged in several ways from
expectations we developed on prior ethnographic work in this community,
including the frequency of child-directed talk, the diversity of
talkers, and the distribution of talk over the course of the day. When
considered together with data from a Mayan community, the findings
suggest that the Panoramic approach, while well suited to gathering
inclusive, ecologically valid estimates of how much linguistic input
children hear, is also far more sensitive to circumstantial variation
(e.g., the number of speakers present) than it is to established
ideological variation in how caregivers talk to children. For the
latter, a Close-Study or hybrid approach is needed (e.g., analyzing
interactional peaks). Whether child language development is better
predicted by meaningful individual differences in average circumstantial
variation (e.g., Panoramic input quantity), ideologically-based
variation (e.g., Close-Study input characteristics; attitudes toward
pedagogical talk), or something in-between is a question for future
work. Cross-cultural and cross-linguistic will have a major role to play
in teasing out the causal factors at play in this larger issue relating
children's early linguistic experience to their later language
development.
