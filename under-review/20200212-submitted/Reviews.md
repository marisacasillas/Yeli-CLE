# To do (next)
- Make a new outline for the intro and discussion
    - Rev1's suggested outline of aims:
        - look at input in child-centric subsistence-farming society to determine factors affecting input quantity
        - look at peaks to investigate whether this reflects child-centricity
        - check milestones to see whether they are effected by the above
- Compress close vs. panoramic discussion
- Add methods details asked for by Rev2
- Consider strength of hypothetical learning mechanisms
- Add weaknesses wrt quality and vocab measures (though note CDS is a 'quality' measure already)
    - Rev1 thinks the findings are unsurprising; maybe add more material on indiv. variation used also in TS paper
- Strengthen introduction of value of peak measures

### Editor
- organization and writing
- add some (?) supplemental materials to the main text
- shorten supplemental materials; posting on open access website (?)
### AE
- lacks focus
- most important result is lost
- PNG childrearing needs to be presented earlier
- Make sure linkage between key questions and results are clearer
### Reviewer 1
- overlong and lacking in focus
- more on methods, which are currently undersold, despite still having significant flaws for investigating ideological differences
- more on implications for language learning
- they want: shorter, more focused paper on subsistence farming input, peak vs. random, and milestones
- intro should provide a rationale for the current study more clearly
- they want a straightforward comparison of NAEng, TS, and YD---they are sampled differently so this could only be done with a big hedge
- be careful about the implications of 'minimal' child-directed speech
- they want a kind of quality analysis of the peaks (we can't offer that presently)
- otherwise not very convinced by the value of the peak interactions analysis
- isn't surprised by the developmental outcomes (word combinations are insensitive to variation in CDS?)
- too much focus on close vs. panoramic in the discussion and not enough on the results
### Reviewer 2
- wants more information about clip selection (also I should clarify that HV was assessed wrt CHI vocal activity)
- wants to know number of utterances coded and interrater reliability (nothing to offer on the latter part directly; Cychosz et al.)
- finds the discussion of close vs. panoramic interesting but maybe not quite situated well
- wants the hypothesis about how learning could take place in these circumstances stated more clearly and described wrt other proposed models of language acquisition (mention N. Chater and C. Mortensen)
- main argument is about quality not quantity, and about vocabulary and grammatical complexity, not milestones. this limitation needs to be better acknowledged
- historical perspective would be welcome at some point: new efforts making progress on old arguments
- some missing words
- the paper needs to "stand alone" better both in terms of the issues raised in the intro/discussion and the details provided in the methods

Both of the reviewers were very enthusiastic about the core elements of this manuscript – both in terms of the non-WEIRD sample you investigated and in terms of the richness of your methodological approach.  However, as Reviewer 1 very clearly lays out, the paper lacks focus and as a result, what seems to be the most important result here (namely, how language acquisition is supported in a non-WEIRD environment) gets a little bit lost.  Indeed, the introduction is almost exclusively about the methods (Close vs Panoramic sampling) and the information about the PNG child-rearing environment isn’t presented until the method section! Thus, a thorough revision of this paper is needed that takes into consideration the comments of both reviewers.

Reviewer 1 advocates for a complete restructuring of the paper that would make the non-WEIRD dimension of the paper the central focus. The methodological approach would then be dramatically shortened and re-cast as a useful way for investigating non-WEIRD cultures (as well as WEIRD ones).  Reviewer 2 notes that it would be useful to give more historical context for how ethnographic investigations of non-WEIRD cultures have posed challenges to current (WEIRD-centric) theorizing.

Moreover, as Reviewer 1 notes, tightening up the focus of the paper will also make it easier to stay focused through the results section, since it will be easier to make clear as you go through to see which results are most critical and how they link to the core questions here.

Comments to the Author
This paper reports the results of an interesting study of the language-learning environment of 10 children in a Papuan community from birth to 3 years, and the timing of their early language milestones, using a daylong recording approach.

The research is clearly publishable in the journsl: the method is sophisticated and well thought-out; the results are appropriately analysed; and the findings have potentially important implications for the field. However, the current version of the paper is overlong and somewhat lacking in focus – with way too much discussion of the difference between close and panoramic approaches and not enough discussion of what the authors’ method and data actually tell us about the language learning process.  In my view, the authors need  to produce a shorter, more focused version of the paper which concentrates on what I take to be the key aims, namely: 1) To look at the language experience of children in a culture which is child-centric (like WEIRD cultures) but where daily life is organised around subsistence farming (like other non-WEIRD cultures), in order to see which of these factors is most important in determining the overall rate of child-directed speech across the day; 2) To look at children’s language experience in peak turn-taking interactions to investigate the extent to which this reflects the child-centric nature of the culture, and 3) To look at the age at which the children reach key milestones in order to draw inferences about the extent to which these are affected by the above factors.

More specific comments

Introduction: The introduction currently reads like an extended discussion of the relative merits of different kinds of methodological approach, much of which is only tangentially relevant to the study that is being reported – and which, in my view, is rather too kind to the traditional approach, which has almost certainly led to an over-estimation of the amount of child-directed speech that children hear in WEIRD as well as non-WEIRD cultures. The authors need to come up with a shorter and more focused introduction that provides a rationale for the study that they have actually done (i.e. an introduction that focuses on a) whether different rates of child-directed speech reflect differences in child-rearing ideologies or differences in the demands of daily life in different cultures; b) whether different child-rearing ideologies result in different ways of interacting with young children during interactional peaks; and c) whether the kind of low rates of child-directed speech found in non-WEIRD cultures affect the age at which children reach different language milestones – and what implications this has for our understanding of the language learning process).

Method: Although the conclusions they are able to draw are obviously limited by the fact that they are only looking at data from 10 children, by focusing so much on the differences between close and panoramic approaches, the authors actually undersell their method, which by sampling both at random and in a targeted way from daylong recordings, allows them both to come up with a realistic estimate of the amount of child-directed speech and other-directed speech that the children actually hear, but also to look at what happens in peak turn-taking interactions – and hence also provide a more in-depth analysis of the kind of child-directed speech the children hear in these interactions – though, unfortunately, the authors’ analysis of the peak turn-taking segments is pretty superficial – and hence does not allow them to say anything very meaningful about how the community’s child-centric ideology affects the nature of the child-directed speech that the children are hearing (see below).

Results: The results section, like the introduction, would benefit from a more focused rewrite. With respect to the first section, the key finding is that the average amount of child-directed speech is just over 3 minutes per hour, which is similar to that reported in a comparable study of children in a Mayan community (despite the difference in ideology) and between a quarter and a third of what is reported in a comparable study of North American children (suggesting that this difference has more to do with the different demands of daily life in these cultures than with differences in ideology). This point would come across much more clearly if the authors presented a straightforward comparison of these 3 rates rather than just the rates in the two non-WEIRD contexts. I also think the authors muddy the waters by talking loosely about the children in their sample hearing ‘minimal’ child-directed speech. ‘Minimal’ is a loaded term that trades off the widespread assumption that children in WEIRD cultures hear hours and hours of child-directed speech every day – when the reality is that, if one looks at the numbers from studies using a similar daylong recording methodology, North American children appear to hear an average of about 100 minutes of child-directed speech per day and the children in this study hear an average of about 30 minutes per day. Sure, 30 is still a lot less than 100, but, when viewed against the more realistic 100-minute reference point, 30 minutes a day can hardly be described as ‘minimal’. The implication of the study is therefore not that children can learn a language despite hearing only a ‘minimal’ amount of child-directed speech (though it’s possible that they can, e.g. by learning through overhearing), but rather that a relatively small amount of child-directed speech per day may be sufficient to ensure that typically developing children reach developmental milestones according to roughly the same timetable as children who happen to be addressed considerably more often.

With respect to the second section, the analysis of the peak turn-taking interactions seems pretty superficial to me. After all, it is hardly surprising that these interactions contain more child-directed speech than the random samples since they have been selected on precisely this basis. Surely what is required here is an analysis of the kind of speech directed to the child during these interactions (and, if possible, a comparison of what has been reported for Mayan and North American children, to understand how any similarities or differences are related to differences in childrearing ideology versus childrearing context).

With respect to the third section, while it is clearly important to establish that children within this culture reach language milestones at more or less the same age as children in WEIRD cultures, it is also important to recognise that the vocal maturity measures presented by the authors are relatively crude and don’t tell us anything about the children’s vocabulary range or the productivity or syntactic complexity of their multi-word speech. Although it may come as a surprise to some researchers in the field, I’m not sure it’s particularly surprising that the ages at which children start to babble, to produce their first words and to start combining words are relatively insensitive to variation in the amount of child-directed speech that they hear. It would be much more surprising if there was no relation between amount of child-directed speech and more fine-grained measures such as vocabulary size, which the authors don’t appear to have for the children in this stufy.

Discussion: The discussion is more focused than the introduction, but there is still too much emphasis on the difference between close and panoramic approaches, and not enough on interpreting the results reported in the actual study. The authors need to work harder on developing an explicit rationale for their study in the introduction, and then use the discussion to reflect back on the questions that the study was designed to investigate. Note that, in suggesting this, I’m not encouraging the authors to engage in HARKing (i.e. Hypothesising After the Results are Known), since they do seem to have some a priori hypotheses that they present at the end of the introduction (albeit hypotheses that actually turn out to be wrong). What I’m saying is that they need to organize their introduction and discussion around these hypotheses rather than around a general (and, frankly, not particularly insightful) discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of close versus panoramic approaches.

This paper reports on a monumental descriptive study of the language experience and early language development of children in a Papuan community which has the aims of evaluating different methods of describing language experience and of bringing a description of children’s experience and development to bear on the question of how children learn language, given the input they get. The basic finding reported is that young children in this community experience little child-directed speech but reach basic milestones of language development on a similar time schedule as children in Western cultures who experience much more child directed speech.

The method that produced these findings was day-long recordings collected via a recorder that the child wore along with a miniature camera that also took photos of what was in front of the child every 15 seconds. The data come from the recordings of 10 children, selected from a larger sample that was recorded to be representative of this population in terms of maternal education, to span the age range from 0 to 3 years, and to have equal numbers of male and female children. Clips of the day-long recording were selected for transcription as follows: 9 2.5 minute clips were selected at random, 5 1-minute clips were manually selected to represent peak turn-taking activity, 5 1-minute clips were selected to represent peak vocal activity (on the part of the child?), and 1 5-minute clip described as an “expansion of the best one-minute clip. The manner in which these clips were selected is available online, but more needs to be said here. The reader doesn’t know enough about the data to proceed without going to the online material, and that shouldn’t be.

Each utterance in these clips produced by the target child was coded as non-canonical babble, canonical babble, single word utterance, multi-word utterance, or unsure. Again, the reader who wants to know more is referred to online material. We should at least know how many utterances were coded and the interrater reliability of the coding.

The randomly selected clips provide the basis for baseline description, including effects of child age, time of day, household size, and number of speakers on the rate of child-directed and other-directed speech. The turn-taking clips provided the basis for describing the speech environment during peak interactions. The children’s linguistic development is described based on cross-sectional measures of the proportion of less and more mature utterance types at each age.

The significant effects in the randomly selected clips indicate regular patterns in the time of day when children hear the most child-directed speech, that most child-directed speech came from adult speakers, that older children heard more child-directed speech from other children than did younger children. In essence, these analyses provide estimates of how much time per hour the child is talked to, how much time per hour the child hears other-directed speech, and these analyses identify the circumstances that influence who will talk to the child and how much. A finding that is important for the study’s larger purpose is that the baseline rate of child-directed speech is low while the rate of other-directed speech is high, compared to Western samples.

The analyses of the clips of peak interaction times yield a different picture—one in which there is much more child-directed speech. This appears to be a central finding of this study—that even in a culture and context where the average rates of child-directed speech are low, there are bursts of dense child-directed speech. Another finding is that even where adults view children as conversational partners—as they do in this community—the circumstances of everyday life shape the timing and overall frequency of their talk to children.

The method and results summarized so far make an important contribution to the field of child language by documenting in greater detail than anyone has to this point the nature of children’s linguistic experience in an unstudied community and some of the factors that shape that experience. Indeed, the introduction to the paper presents the research as an investigation into the difference in results that come from day-long recordings vs. recordings of shorter, more structured interactions. This is an important and interesting argument, but in reading it ones feels as though one has walked in on the middle of a conversation and missed some important background. The paper introduces the terms “Panoramic method” and “close study.” I tend to be against the introduction of new terms where existing words will suffice. At a minimum the contrasting approaches need to be better defined—is ethnography part of both, for example?

The next contribution this paper aims to make is to consider how language acquisition occurs, given such circumstances. The paper takes the descriptive, cross sectional findings with respect to age at which the milestones of canonical babbling, first words, and so on appear as evidence that language acquisition proceeds in a typical fashion, raising the question of how the children do it. The paper offers the argument that the bursts of high-density input provide the data for learning and the quiet periods offer the opportunity for consolidation. (It is not quite clear if consolidation is meant in the traditional learning and memory sense or also includes off-line processing of stored, unanalyzed input.) A serious treatment of this hypothesis needs to make this clear and then also tackle how such a proposal fits with other proposed models of language acquisition. Hypothesis testing v. building networks approaches, and the now-or-never bottleneck argument (multiple papers and a book by N. Chater and C. Mortensen).

In considering the theoretical implications of the finding, the paper makes good and appropriate arguments about the need for more research and, in particular, for studies of what child might learn from overheard speech. There is an important limitation of the study that is not adequately acknowledged: the language development measures are the age at which basic milestones are reached, and the measure of input is quantity. I think most researchers in the field would agree at this point that the quality of input matters more than quantity. Second, the many findings in the literature on effects of variability in the quantity and quality of input on children’s language development do not claim effects on the timing of major milestones. Rather it is the size of vocabulary, the rate of vocabulary growth, and the grammatical complexity of speech that are the associated outcome variables. So maybe input doesn’t matter for reaching milestones and does matter for other sorts of individual differences. How will we ever know?

Relatedly, this paper would benefit from a bit more of a historical perspective. The challenge to theories of language acquisition from ethnographic descriptions of societies in which children hear little child-directed speech goes back to the 1970s, as some of the citations in this paper acknowledge. What this paper does not address, but perhaps should, is how this new sort of effort might enable new progress on an old argument.

The paper is very well written. There are a few sentences missing words that I’m sure will be caught in revision. The major difficulty for the reader is that the paper does not stand alone very well. It would be helpful to orient readers to the issues more in the introduction and to make the methods sufficiently clear so that readers can follow along without reading other cited background papers or looking up supplemental material.
