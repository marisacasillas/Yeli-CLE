Dear Dr. Casillas:

It is a pleasure to conditionally accept your manuscript entitled "Early language experience in a Papuan community" for publication in the Journal of Child Language.

The comments of the Action Editor (AE) and reviewer(s) are included at the bottom of this letter. I would like to now ask you to prepare a final revision, submitting production-ready files, based on these comments. To facilitate this process, please highlight changes in the text as appropriate. I would also like to request that you place your appendix as online supplemental materials as it is too long to be in print. You can contact the editorial assistant, Miles Lambert, at  child_language@yahoo.co.uk  to find out how to do this.

We expect to receive your manuscript within 30 days.  It will come directly to me.

**>> Thank you for this opportunity. We have addressed one of reviewer 1's points, made a read-through for typos, and have unblinded the paper so that it is ready for final editor checks and, hopefully, production.**

This is a much improved version of this paper!  One reviewer did have a few suggestions about how you might want to clarify/add some information to keep the paper in closer dialog with some general debates about the role of input.  If you wish to address them in the final submitted version, you are most welcome to do so.

**>> Thank you for this the kind comments! We are grateful to the editor and reviewers for helping us to improve the paper. As stated above: We have addressed one of reviewer 1's points, made a read-through for typos, and have unblinded the paper so that it is ready for final editor checks and, hopefully, production.**

Comments to the Author
This paper makes an important contribution to the literature on the range of circumstances in which children acquire language. All of the previous concerns about the organization and clarity of the manuscript have been addressed.

There are two matters of content that I feel could be better addressed. I’ll repeat them here, and I leave it to the editors and to the authors to decide what to do with them.

1. The introduction frames the paper as a test of whether caregiver ideology or lifestyle shapes the language input a culture provides its children and concludes that it is lifestyle. It would be interesting for the authors to talk about how that conclusion applies to differences in input associated with family socioeconomic status—within the same post-industrial society.

**>> We feel that, while thought-provoking, a generalization along these lines is far too much of a stretch on the basis of the current dataset. The intended scope of our paper is clear from the introduction as comparing, "specifically, subsistence farming vs. post-industrial lifestyles." Therefore we have chosen not to take up this suggestion.**


2. The paper makes the claim that despite less language exposure than in North American samples, the children on Rossel Island reach language production milestones on a schedule comparable to that observed in North America. The paper then discusses theories of language acquisition consistent with the finding that language acquisition requires less child-directed speech than some have argued. My quarrel with this is that the strong and robust effects of amount of input on language development in the literature do not use the age of reaching these production milestones as their measures of language development. They use vocabulary size (Hart & Risley, 1995; Hoff, 2003) and diversity of complex structures (Huttenlocher et al., 2010), for example, as the measures. It seems entirely possible to me that the timetable of achieving the basic production milestones has a strong maturational component that makes only minimal requirements of input. In contrast, the size of a child’s vocabulary and the range of syntactic structures at his or her command are more closely tied to the quantity and quality of the information provided in input. Of course, the authors may disagree with this. But they should acknowledge that the literature on input effects they are addressing makes use of different outcome measures than theirs. In its current form, I feel that the paper assumes—without saying so--that the difference in measures does not matter and proceeds to try and explain what the authors take to be conflicting findings.

**>> We have now further underscored this point by revising the first sentence of the Limitations section as follows "Our language outcome measures, which track the onset and relative usage frequency of broad linguistic phenomena, crucially differ from those used in prior work establishing a relationship between child vocabulary and input quality measures.**

Comments to the Author
This is a much improved submission in which the authors have used the editor's and reviewers' comments to produce a much tighter and more focused version of the paper. It needs another proof read in order to correct a few typos, but, other than that, I am now happy to recommend that it be accepted for publication in the journal.

**>> We have checked again for typos and hope the current version is typo-free.**
